#AE 220 : Aircraft Structures

## Notes

### Inertial Moments

__Tips__:

* Total force applied on object = ( Linear acc. of CG due to n_x * Mass of CG ) + ( Angular acc of CG * distace from pt. of rotation * Mass of CG )
* Total moment applied on object = ( Total force applied * Distance of pt. of application from CG ) + ( Moment of Inertial * angular acc. )
* Above formulae stand for discrete distribution
* For continuous distribution, integrate

__Imp__:

* The methods used in Quiz question 2 and Tutorial 1, question 3
