# AE 214 : Thermodynamics

## Formulae

1. T(A) = T(B) & T(B) = T(C) $$\implies$$ T(A) = T(C)

## Notes

### Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

If two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

By replacing the third body with a thermometer, the law can be restated as two bodies are in thermal equilibrium if both have the same temperature reading even if they are not in contact.

### Temperature Scales

In thermodynamics, it is desirable to have a temperature scale that is independent of any property of a substance.

* degree C: 0, 100: freezing, boiling points of water at 1 atm P
* degree F: 32, 180: same as above. Another 2 point scale
* K: 0: absolute Zero, by extrapolating curves of ideal behaviour of gases. Measure using constant V thermometers of H or He at low P.

T = a + bP, a,b depend on the gas.

-273.15 K = 0 C, and so on.

1 K = 1/273.16 of Triple point of water

### Thermometers

Types of commonly used thermometers:
* Constant volume gas thermometer , T(P)
* Constant pressure gas thermometer, T(V)
* Electric resistance thermometer, T(R)
* Thermocouple, T(Îµ)
* Liquid-in-glass thermometer, T(L)
