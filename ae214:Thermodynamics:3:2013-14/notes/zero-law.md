# AE 214 : Thermodynamics

## Formulae

1. T(A) = T(B) & T(B) = T(C) $$\implies$$ T(A) = T(C)

## Notes

### Specific Heat

Amount of energy required to raise the temperature of unit mass of different substances by one degree

* Specific heat at constant volume $$c_v$$dT = du at const V
* Specific heat at constant pressure $$c_p$$dT = dh at const P

Specific heats are properties of system and for a substance change with temperature.

Because at constant pressure the system is allowed to expand and the energy for the expansion must also be supplied, cp > cv

### NASA Polynomials

* <Substance> <State><Code> <c1, c2, c3, c4> <T1> <T2> <T3> <line>
* a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 <line> x3

For range T2 to T3, use the first 7 numbers, for range T1 to T2, <<not mentioned>>

* Cp/R = a1 + a2 T + a3 T^2 + a4 T^3 + a5 T^4
* H/RT = a1 + a2 T /2 + a3 T^2 /3 + a4 T^3 /4 + a5 T^4 /5 + a6/T
* S/R = a1 lnT + a2 T + a3 T^2 /2 + a4 T^3 /3 + a5 T^4 /4 + a7

### Energy Transfer

#### Heat

The form of energy that is transferred between two systems (or a system and its surroundings) only by virtue of a temperature difference. It is energy in transition, only recognised if it crosses the system boundary.

Larger temperature difference means higher rate of heat transfer. Mechanisms:

1. Conduction, $$ \dot{Q} = \frac{\kappa A\Delta T}{x}$$
* Convection, $$ \dot{Q} = h A\Delta T$$
* Radiation, $$ \dot{Q} = \sigma T^4 A$$


#### Energy

Any energy interaction of a closed system other than heat is work, ie, An energy interaction that is not caused by a temperature difference between a system and its surroundings is work.

Work is the energy transfer associated with a force acting through a distance.

####Similarities

* Both heat and work are boundary phenomena.Systems possess energy, but not heat or work.
* Both are associated with a process, not a state. Unlike properties, heat or work has no meaning at a state.
* Both are path functions (i.e., their magnitudes depend on the path followed during a process as well as the end states)

#### Sign convention

* Heat transfer to a system and work done by a system are positive
* Heat transfer from a system and work done on a system are negative
