# AE 214 : Thermodynamics

## Formulae

## Notes

### Path and Point functions

* __Point functions__: P, T, $$\vartheta$$, h, s, cp, cv, etc.
* __Path__: W, Q

$$\int_1^2$$dV = V2 - V1, but $$\int_1^2 \delta$$W is not W2 - W1

### Work

Work done by a system on its surroundings during a process is defined as that interaction whose sole effect external to the system could be viewed as the raising of a mass through a
distance against gravity

* __Displacement work__: Moving boundary or displacement work is of significant interest to engineers. The boundary work done during a process depends on the path followed as well as
* the end states

W = $$\int$$P dV = Area under P-V graph during a quasi-equilibrium expansion or compression process of a closed system

Net work during a cycle is the difference between the work done by the system and the work done on the system

### Joule's Experiments

Joule’s experiment laid the foundation of the first law of thermodynamics.

He found that the work done is proportional to the heat transfer, with the constant of proportionality as the Joule’s equivalent
