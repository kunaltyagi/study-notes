# AE 214 : Thermodynamics

## Formulae

## Notes

### Types of ThermoD

* Macroscopic Approach (Classical ThermoD): Usefull
* Microscopic Approach (Statistical ThermoD): Uses Kinetic Theory of Gases

### Continuum

* Disregard the atomic nature of a substance and view it as a continuous, homogeneous matter with no holes
* The continuum idealization allows us to treat properties as point functions and to assume the properties vary continually in space with no jump discontinuities

### System and Control Volume

* __System__:a quantity of matter in space chosen for study
    * __Closed__ - no mass transfer, energy transfer possible
    * __Open__ - also called control volume, mass and energy transfer possible
    * __Isolated__ -neither energy nor mass transfer possible
* __Surroundings__: mass or region that surrounds a system, and may be affected by it
* __Boundary__: real or imaginary surface that separates a system from its surroundings which may or may not be stationary
* __Universe__: system and its surroundings
* __Control Volume__: volume surrounded by the boundary in an __Open System__

### Property

Any characteristic of a system like T, P, $$\rho$$, m, etc.

* __Intensive__ property: independent of mass like T, P
* __Extensive__ property: dependent on size or mass of the system like m, V, mv
* __Specific__ properties: extensive properties per unit mass, like p(=P/m), $$\vartheta$$(=V/m)

### State

A set of properties that __completely defines the condition of a system__. At a given state, all the properties of a system have fixed values, and any change in them results in a __change of system__

### Equilibrium

In an equilibrium state there are __no unbalanced potentials__ within the system, so it experiences no changes when it is isolated from its surroundings.

A system is not in thermodynamic equilibrium unless the conditions of all the relevant types of equilibrium are satisfied. Also, in thermodynamic equilibrium, it __does not deliver any useful work__

* __Thermal equilibrium__: if the temperature is the same throughout the system
* __Mechanical equilibrium__: if the pressure is the same throughout the system
* __Chemical equilibrium__: if the chemical composition does not change with time, i.e., no chemical reactions occur
* __Phase equilibrium__: when the mass of each phase reaches an equilibrium level and stays there

### State Postulate

State of a gas can be fixed by 2 __independent, intensive properties__, like  T & $$\vartheta$$, but not p and $$\vartheta$$ (in case of a phase change)

### Path, cycle and Process

* __Process__: Any change that a system undergoes from one equilibrium state to another.
* __Path__: The series of states through which a system passes during a process.
* __Cycle__: If the system returns to its initial state at the end of the process

### Types of processes

Usually during a process, we allow one of the properties to remain a constant:

1. Isothermal process: constant T
* Isobaric process: constant P
* Isochoric process: constant V
* Isentropic process: constant entropy(H)
 Isenthalpic process: constant enthalpy(S)


* __Quasi-static processes__: When a process proceeds in such a manner that the system remains infinitesimally close to an equilibrium state at all times, giving it time to adjust internally and prevent change of state in one part to be faster than the change in another.
    * are easy to analyse
    * max. work produceed by devises under this type of processes
    * standards for actual processes

### Energy

* __Macroscopic__: Energy that a system possesses as a whole with respect to some outside reference frame. 
    * KE $$\frac{mv^2}{2}$$, ke = $$\frac{v^2}{2}$$
    * PE mgz, pe = gz
* __Microscopic__:These are related to the molecular structure of a system and the degree of the molecular activity and are independent of the outside reference frames. U(internal E), u(=U/m)

#### Internal Energy

* __Sensible energy__: Part of the internal energy associated with kinetic energy of molecules. Rotational KE, translational KE, vibrational KE
* __Latent energy__: Internal energy associated with phase change of a system
* __Chemical energy__: Internal energy associated with the atomic bonds in a molecule
* __Nuclear energy__: Tremendous amount of energy associated with the strong bonds within the nucleus of the atom

#### Total Energy

E = KE + PE + U
e = ke + pe + u
