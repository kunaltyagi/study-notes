#AE 220 : Aircraft Structures

## Notes

###__Monocoqe Structures__

* Single shell construction
* Skin carries structural loads
* Eliminates heavy trusses
* __Bulkhead__ + __Formers__ at regular intervals, and stressed __Skin__

###__Semi-monocoque Structures__

* __Reinforced__ monocoque to prevent __buckling__ for __fuselage__ and __wing__ design
* Thin wall shell, with stiffening members

####Members

* __Wings__
    * __Spar:__ __Longitudinal beam__ parallel to wing, attached to both top and lower skin, has 2 __Caps__ and a __Web__
    * __Stringer:__ __Longitudinal skin stiffener__, smaller than spar, attached to either lower or upper skin surface
    * __Ribs:__ __Perpendicular__ to spars, stringers, and wing, cover the __entire structural cross-section__
* __Fuselage__
    * __Frame/Ring:__ __Transverse skin stiffener__, __perpendicular__ to fuselage
    * __Bulkhead:__ heavy frame, __covers greater portion__ of the cross-section than a ring
    * __Longeron:__ Heavy __longitudinal stiffener parallel__ to the fuselage
    * __Stringer:__ Small __Longitudinal skin stiffener__, smaller than longeron, parallel to the fuselage

####Functions

* __Skin__
    * __Transmit aerodynamic forces__ to longitudinal & transverse supporting members
    * __Develop shearing stresses__ which bear the __applied torsional moments and shear forces__.
    * __Bear bending loads__ with other longitudinal members 
    * __Bear hoop force__ with _transverse members_, & __axial force__ with _longitudinal members_ when __structure is pressurized__.
    * __Provide an aerodynamic surface and cover__ for the contents of the
vehicle
* __Stringers/Spars/Longerons__ _(Longitudinal members)_
    * Help __resist bending momets & axial loads__
    * __Divide the skin into smaller panels__ to __increase buckling stresses__
    * Act together __with the skin__ in __resisting axial and hoop stress forces__ caused by __pressurization__
* __Ribs/Frames/Bulkheads__ _(Transverse members)_
