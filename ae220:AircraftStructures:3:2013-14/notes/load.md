## Notes

### Inertial Load

__D'Alembert's Principle__: Inertial Load is $$ \propto $$ its acceleration, in opposite direction

$$ \sum{F_x} + ma_x = 0 $$ --> Dynamic Equilibrium Equation

### Load Factor

__Load Factor__ ( $$ n_x $$ ): Force acting in some direction minus the gravitational and inertial force in the same direction, whole divided by the weight in the same direction.

$$ n_x = \frac{a_x}{g} $$

$$ n_y $$ = 1 + $$ \frac{a_y}{g} $$ in presence of gravity in only y direction. Any n can be negative.
