#AE 220 : Aircraft Structures

## Notes

###Materials

1. Metals
    * Have a __relatively high Youngâ€Ÿs modulus, E__
    * The pure metals __can be made stronger by alloying or by mechanical processes__
    * Metals are __usually ductile__ and can be _extruded or drawn into wires_

2. Polymers
    * __Light-weight__
    * __Have low moduli__, of the order of $$ \frac{1}{50} $$ that of metals. 
    * __Properties depend strongly on temperature__

3. Elastomers
    * __Polymers with low stiffness__
    * __Easily stretched__ but __recover original shape__ when _the load is removed_.

4. Ceramics and Glasses
    * __High E__
    * __Hard and abrasion resistant__
    * __Retain strength at high temperatures and resist corrosion__
    * __Brittle__
    * __Strength is degraded by small chips, cracks or internal defects__

5. Composites
    * __Weight reduction__ (20-50%)
    * __Corrision resistant__
    * __Fatigue resistant__
    * __Tailorable mechanical properties__

###Requirements

1. Metals
    * Mechanical properties
        * __High stiffness__
        * __High Strength to Weight ratio__
        * __High Yield Strength__
        * __Ductility__ or __Fracture Toughness__: Plasticity helps retard the crack growth
        * __Fatigue Resistance__
        * __Corrosion Resistance__
        * __Creep resistance__
    * Manufacturing related
        * Machinability
        * Producability
    * Other
        * Cost
        * Availability

### Other details

* __Endurance Limit__ ( $$ {\sigma}_{e}): Fatigue strength at $$ 10^7 $$ cycles
* __Tensile strength__ ( $$ {\sigma}_{ts}): Max bearable stress. After this point, strain increases even with decreasing stress
* __0.2% Proof stress__ ( $$ {\sigma}_{y}): Stress at which plasticity on removing load is only 0.2%
* __Elongation__ ( $$ {\epsilon}_{f} $$): Static strain at no stress
