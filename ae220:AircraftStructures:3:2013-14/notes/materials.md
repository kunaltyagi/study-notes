#AE 220 : Aircraft Structures

## Formulae

## Notes

###Materials

1. Metals
    * Have a __relatively high Youngâ€Ÿs modulus, E__
    * The pure metals __can be made stronger by alloying or by mechanical processes__
    * Metals are __usually ductile__ and can be _extruded or drawn into wires_

2. Polymers
    * __Light-weight__
    * __Have low moduli__, of the order of 1/50 that of metals. 
    * __Properties depend strongly on temperature__

3. Elastomers
4. Ceramics
5. Glasses
    * __High E__
    * __Hard and abrasion resistant__
    * __Retain strength at high temperatures and resist corrosion__
    * __Brittle__
    * __Strength is degraded by small chips, cracks or internal defects__

6. Composites
